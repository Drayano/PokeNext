# PokeNext

This is a PokeDex Webapp written using the Next.js framework for React
For now it's hosted on Vercel : https://poke-next-drayano.vercel.app/

It's still a Work-In-Progress for now, I plan on implementing a detailed pokemon view for each pokemon and then eventually move to implementing Items and Moves details.
